A Haskell syntax highlighting library with tokenizers derived
from KDE XML syntax highlighting descriptions.

A command-line highlighter, `skylighting`, is also provided.

Motivation
----------

This library is the successor to [highlighting-kate], which had
some problems that were difficult to resolve given its
architecture.

In highlighting-kate, the XML syntax descriptions were converted
into individual parsec parsers, which were then compiled.  This
made it difficult to handle IncludeRules properly without
circular imports.  There was also no way to load a syntax
description dynamically.

Skylighting, by contrast, parses the XML syntax descriptions
into Haskell data structures, which are then interpreted by
a "tokenize" function.  IncludeRules can now be handled
properly, and users can add new syntax descriptions
dynamically.  It is also now possible to convert `.theme` files
directly into styles.

Skylighting is also faster than highlighting-kate, by a
factor of 3 in some cases.

Installing
----------

To install the latest release from Hackage, do

    stack install skylighting
or

    cabal install skylighting

If you want the command-line tool, set the `executable` flag
using `--flag "skylighting:executable"` in stack or
`-fexecutable` in cabal.

The release tarballs include generated files not present in this
repository.  Building from this repository is a two-step
process.  In the first step we build a program,
`skylighting-extract`, which reads XML syntax highlighting
definitions from the `xml` directory and writes Haskell source
files.  In the second we actually build the library.

Using cabal:

    cabal install -fbootstrap --disable-optimization
    cabal run skylighting-extract -- xml/*.xml
    cabal install -f-bootstrap

Command-line tool
-----------------

A command-line executable, `skylighting`, is installed if
the `executable` cabal flag is set in building.

For help, `skylighting --help`.

Adding new syntaxes
-------------------

To compile with additional syntaxes, simply add the syntax
definition (XML) file to the `xml` directory and repeat the
bootstrap build described above.

Note that both the library and the executable can dynamically
load syntax definitions, so you may not need to compile them
in.

License
-------

Skylighting is licensed under the GPL, because some of the xml
syntax descriptions from which its tokenizers are generated are
GPL-licensed.
